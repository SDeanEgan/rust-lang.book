### [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Personal Project

This is the repo for my first experience learning the Rust programming language. 

Included are the project directories for the projects included in the text's chapters. 

I may expand what's here once I have completed the book! 

If you happen to find yourself curious about rust, consider visiting [The Rust Book Experiment](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) for an enhanced version.
